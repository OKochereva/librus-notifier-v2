## Notes

- **State File Management**: When fixing ID generation issues, state files may need to be cleared and regenerated to ensure proper change detection
- **API Dependencies**: This system relies on the unofficial `librus-api` library which may change without notice
- **Error Handling**: The system distinguishes between blocking errors (network/auth failures) and non-blocking errors (individual data fetch failures)
